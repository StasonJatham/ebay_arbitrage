# ebay_arbitrage

This code does not work anymore, but it once was one of the most comprehensiove retail scrapers out there. 

The idea was to scrape deals and prices of trending items from all over Europe as there are large price differences. I have found sneakers that are being sold for 90 Euros in Germany and are being sold for 300 GBP in England. I wrote these scripts to calcultae the price arbitrage chances and sell this as-a-service. 

I have not kept up witht he ever changing websites, some of this code may still work, some does not. Maybe one day I will pick up the pieces.
